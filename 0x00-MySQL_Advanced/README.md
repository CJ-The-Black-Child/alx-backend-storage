# Title: MySQL_Advanced
This project contains tasks that demonstrates advanced SQL features

## Tasks Completed
+ [x] 0. **Unique Users**<br/>0-uniq_users.sql - Creates a table 'users' with unique email addresses.
+ [x] 1. **Users by Country**<br/>1-country_users.sql - Creates a table 'users' with a country field.
+ [x] 2. **band Ranking**<br/>2-fans.sql - Ranks bands by their total number of fans
+ [x] 3. **Longevity of Bands**<br/>3-metal_bands.sql - Lists all bands with 'Glam roc' as their main style, ranked by their longevity.
+ [x] 4. **Inventory Management**<br/>4-store.sql - Creates a trigger that decreases the quantity of an iterm after a new order is added.
+ [x] 5. **Email Validation**<br/>5-validate.sql - Creates a trigger that resets the 'valid_email' attribute only when the email has been changed.
+ [x] 6. **Bonus Additions**<br/>6bonus.sql - Creates a stored procedre that ads a new correction.
+ [x] 7. **Score Averaging**<br/>7average_score.sql - Creates a stored procedre that computes and stores the average score for a student.
+ [x] 8. **Optimized Search**<br/>8-index_my_names.sql - Creates an index on the first letter of the 'name' field in the 'names' table.
+ [x] 9. **Optimized Search**<br/>9-index_name_score.sql - Creates an index on the first letter of the 'name' field and the 'score' field in the 'names' table.
+ [x] 10. **Safe Division**<br/>10-div.sql - Creates a function 'SafeDiv' that divides the first number by the second number or returns 0 if the second number is equal to 0.
+ [x] 11. **Meeting Requirements**<br/>11-need_meeting.sql - Creates a function 'need_meeting' that lists all the students that have a score under 80(strict) and no last_leeting or more than 1 month
+ [x] 12. **Weighted Score Averaging**<br/>100-average_weighted_score.sql - Creates a stored procedure 'ComputeAverageWeightedScoreForUser' that computes and stores the average weighted score for a student.
+ [x] 13. **Weighted Score Averaging for All**<br/>101-average_weighted_score.sql - Creates a stored procedure 'ComputeAverageWeightedScoreForAll' that computes and stores the average weighted score for all students.

This project is a great resource for understanding how to use advanced SQL features in practical scenarios.
